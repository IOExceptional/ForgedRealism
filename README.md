# Forged Realism

This mod is an attempt at heightened realism inside minecraft, by introducing temperature and thirst into the game as well as the standard hunger.


## Temperature System

Each biome has a temperature value which then affects the players temperature.

The snow biome is the coldest and the desert is the hottest during the day.

When your character is colder, they will move slower and begin losing life when they are below a certain temperature.

When your character is warmer, their water level decreases more rapidly and slowly become delirious in searing heat.

Armour keeps you warmer but certain sets keep you warmer than others.


## Thirst System

Like hunger, water levels drain during activities. It is essential that your character is kept watered otherwise they will become delirious and lose their sanity.
